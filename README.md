# Shadertoy Studies
Miscellaneous personal studies of a few shadertoy (GLSL) concepts.
Did this to start learning about 2D and 3D shaders, and to have a better understanding on how these shaders actually process data.

A study on a procedurally generated maze, oscillating between two different line shapes.



raymarching.glsl https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DdG3Rd

My first attempt at ray-marching 3D rendering.



raymarching2.glsl https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DdV3Wy

A mess I made while messing around some more ray-marching fundamentals.
